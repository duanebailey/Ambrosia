    "# Laboratory 3 (Sweeps and Extrudes)\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "We play with swept and extruded Mesh objects, as well as Prism and Spindle objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is required.\n",
    "This week I would like you to construct a new model|anything you wish, but it must include at least one extruded Mesh or Prism object and a swept Mesh or Spindle object. Again, it does not have to be a substantial model, but it should demonstrate your facility with these primitives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some guidelines to follow:**\n",
    "1. Please construct your model (as before) in a *hierarchical manner*: primitive and grouped objects, grouped together to form the whole. Use comments to make your model more readable. (You might do this experiment: look at your last model and see if you can still quickly understand how it works. If not: you need more comments.)                                                        \n",
    "2. Use an extrude-based Mesh or a Prism primitive object:                    \n",
    "   * To extrude a cube we would construct a Mesh object with:\n",
    "       \n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       frontFace = [(-50,-50,-50),(50,-50,-50),(50,50,-50),(-50,50,-50)]\n",
    "       box = extrude(frontFace,translate(0,0,100))\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "   * To construct a cube from a Prism, we might:\n",
    "                 \n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        frontFace = raisePoly([(-50,-50),(50,-50),(50,50),(-50,50)]) \n",
    "        box = Prism().profile(frontFace)\n",
    "        ```  \n",
    "        \n",
    "3. Use a sweep-based Mesh or a Spindle object:\n",
    "    * To sweep an octagonal planter with an 8-sided hole in the bottom:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        # this planter has an octagonal drain hole in the bottom\n",
    "        cutaway = raisePoly([(10,0),(50,0),(75,50),(75,60),(60,60), (60,50),(50,10),(10,10),(10,0)]) \n",
    "        planter = sweep(cutaway,8)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * To construct a round flower pot (with a round hole):\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        # define cutaway as above \n",
    "        flowerPot = Lathe().profile(cutaway)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If you haven't already, experiment with CSG primitives (differences and intersections).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Turn in your best image as a .png file and your model as a .py file. **Make sure you turn in your image and model in a folder, labeled with your name:** Lastname-Lab3. **Models not turned in in a folder with not be graded.**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, update your wiki (we're all watching!) with a section describing your new model called == Model with Sweep and Extrude == "
