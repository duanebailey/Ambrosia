    "One of the basic building blocks in Ambrosia are shapes. You can use Ambrosia to build whatever shape you want. However, for now, lets start with Ambrosia built in shapes. Among the built in shapes, there are cubes, spheres, cones and cylinders. Before going any further, it is important to note that inorder for the Ambrosia system to work, the following statement should be the first command of your Ambrosia commands. This tells the Python to include Ambrosia functionality so that you are able to use it.\n"
