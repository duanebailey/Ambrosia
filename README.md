# The Ambrosia Modeing System.
Welcome to the Ambrosia Modeling System repository.  This system is a 3D-Modeling
language used to introduce students to programming and to demonstrate various
approaches to engineering large systems.  Ambrosia is used in Computer Science 109,
The Art and Science of Computer Graphics, taught at Williams College.

Most of the materials for the course may be found here.  In particular, this repository
contains:
1. The Ambrosia Modeling System.  Ambrosia is a language embedded in Python 3.
2. Reference documentation for Ambrosia.  To make full use of Ambrosia, it is important
to understand its approach to model-building.  A variety of documentation can be found
on the wiki associated with this site (look above).
3. Lecture notes from the course.  When this repository is explored as a binder, you
can learn about Ambrosia programming using the "lecture" notebooks found in the 'lectures'
folder.  In this on-line approach, we are not constrained by a semester's meetings, so
the progression of lectures is really a path through a tutorial on a wide variety of topics.
The order of the topics, here, follows closely how the course is taught at Williams.
4. Studio exercises.  In the college course, we meet once weekly to build new models.
These 'studio' exercises can be conquered approximately every-other lecture.  As you
explore the lecture notebooks, we'll tell you when to visit the next studio project.
They associated notebooks are all found in the 'studios' folder.
5. Example projects.  As we near the end of the scheduled material, at Williams, we
launch into a more significant project.  In the on-line course, we explore a small collection
of final projects from artists at Williams.

# Let's get started!
This repository is meant to be accessed through mybinder.org.  You can get live access to the python resources by pressing this button: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/duanebailey/Ambrosia/master).
Visiting the binder causes a server in the cloud to give you a fresh copy of the course, in a container.  You can
experiment with notebooks in the course, but if you make changes, they will be lost if you leave the site.  We encourage you
to save your work, locally, on your own machine.  You can  always reload your own version of the notebooks when you
ask for a new binder.

Good luck!  And: have fun modeling.
